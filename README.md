Just some exercises based on practicepython.org

#100_years_old

Asks for the user's name and age, and for a random number.
Then prints "(name) you will turn 100 years old in the year (year))" ,
where (name) is the user's name and (year) is the calculated year when they will turn 100 years old.
This prints as many times as the random number which the user picked.


#even_odd_divide

Firstly requests a number and checks whether it is even or odd, and if it is a multiple of 4.
Then it requests two numbers and checks if the second number divides evenly into the first one.
In all cases above, an appropriate message is printed.
